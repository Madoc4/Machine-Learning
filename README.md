# Machine-Learning

## GAN Setup
To use the GAN, you will first have to have a folder of images to trainthe generator and discriminator on. These should be inside of another folder in your project's folder (Machine-Learning/Photos/Images you would use "Photos" in the dataroot loader). Next, select the number of epochs you would like to run the program for (keep in mind this could take a while). The images generated will be saved in an "output" folder in the project directory.
